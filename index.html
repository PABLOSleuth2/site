<p>Dear Roblox Support,

I hope this message finds you well. My child, Ersultan, has been encountering difficulties resetting their PIN on their Roblox account. They have attempted to follow the provided options but keep receiving a request to involve a parent.

As their parent, I can confirm that Ersultan is the account holder and is eager to continue enjoying the platform safely and securely. Could you please provide guidance on how we can assist them in resetting their PIN without any further delays?

We appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your prompt response.

Sincerely,
Monshak Zaumitova</p>
